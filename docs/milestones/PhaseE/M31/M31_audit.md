# M31 Milestone Audit

**Milestone:** M31 — FULL-TRAINING-RUN-001  
**Mode:** DELTA AUDIT  
**Range:** `9557d57...104aaaf`  
**CI Status:** 🟢 Green (all 11 jobs passing)  
**Audit Verdict:** 🟢 **PASS** — Implementation complete, schemas validated, CI green, ready for execution phase

---

## Executive Summary (Delta-First)

### Wins

1. **Training infrastructure established**: `TrainingConfigLockV1` and `TrainingRunReportV1` schemas provide immutable, auditable contracts for training runs
2. **Data separation enforced**: Training dataset v2 generator is explicitly causally separated from frozen eval v2 (different seeds, prefixes, record keys)
3. **CI validation without execution**: New `m31-schema-validation` job validates schemas and generator without triggering actual training
4. **Latent bug discovered and fixed**: Non-deterministic `hash()` behavior in existing tests was identified and corrected with a robust test

### Risks

1. **New code coverage**: `m31_training_runner.py` at 13.13% coverage (execution paths untested until actual run)
2. **Training dataset generator**: `training_dataset_v2.py` at 84.62% coverage (some edge cases in CLI/verification paths)
3. **Execution complexity**: M31 execution phase involves multi-hour GPU training — execution risks deferred to that phase
4. **Schema complexity**: 12 new Pydantic models with nested structures — covered by validation tests

### Most Important Next Action

**Execute M31 training phase**: Generate production dataset manifest, lock config, run FP32 training, emit artifacts

## Delta Map & Blast Radius

### What Changed

| Category | Files | Lines |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Schemas (JSON) | 2 | 574 |
| Pydantic models | 1 | 598 |
| Dataset generator | 2 | 477 |
| Training runner | 1 | 565 |
| Tests | 2 | 762 |
| CI workflow | 1 | 204 |
| Documentation | 2 | 360 |

### Risky Zones

| Zone | Risk Level | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Auth | 🟢 None | No auth changes |
| Tenancy | 🟢 None | No tenancy changes |
| Persistence | 🟡 Low | New dataset manifest format (compatible with existing V2) |
| Workflow glue | 🟢 Low | New CI job is additive, validation-only |
| Migrations | 🟢 None | No database changes |
| Concurrency | 🟢 None | Training is single-threaded |

---

## Architecture & Modularity Review

### Keep (Good Patterns)

- **Schema-first design**: JSON schemas defined before Pydantic models
- **Canonical JSON for hashing**: Uses `determinism.canonical_json_dump()` for all hash computation
- **Separation of concerns**: Training runner separate from dataset generator
- **Existing model reuse**: Uses existing `BaselinePolicyV1`, `OutcomeHeadV1` without modification

### Fix Now (None Required)

All issues resolved during implementation.

### Defer (Tracked)

| Item | Deferred To | Reason |
|------|-------------|--------|
| AMP support | Post-v1 | M31 is FP32-only by design |
| Hyperparameter tuning | Post-v1 | Template configs locked |
| Checkpoint versioning | Post-v1 | Not critical for M31 execution |

---

## CI/CD & Workflow Audit

### Required Checks Alignment

All 11 jobs passed on final CI run:

| Job | Status | Role |
|-----|--------|------|
| Lint and Format | ✅ | Code quality |
| Type Check | ✅ | Type safety |
| Security Scan | ✅ | Vulnerability detection |
| Test | ✅ | Functional correctness |
| Performance Benchmarks | ✅ | Regression detection |
| Calibration Evaluation | ✅ | Model quality |
| Recalibration Evaluation | ✅ | Calibration stability |
| Frozen Eval V2 Validation (M30) | ✅ | Eval data integrity |
| M31 Schema Validation | ✅ | Schema correctness |
| Runtime Recalibration Guard (M26) | ✅ | Guard validation |
| Runtime Recalibration Evaluation (M27) | ✅ | Recalibration quality |

### Action Pinning

All actions in `ci.yml` are SHA-pinned (verified by existing Security Scan job).

### CI Root Cause Summary

Initial CI failure was due to coverage regression in `models/baseline_v1.py`:
- **Root cause**: Python's non-deterministic `hash()` function caused different coverage paths between local and CI
- **Fix**: Added `test_baseline_policy_v1_forward_uniform_distribution_guaranteed` with `move_vocab_size=1` to guarantee hash collisions
- **Guardrail**: Test now works across all Python configurations

## Tests & Coverage (Delta-Only)

### Coverage Delta

| File | Before | After | Delta |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| `training_dataset_v2.py` | N/A | 84.62% | New file |
| `m31_training_runner.py` | N/A | 13.13% | New file (execution paths) |
| `models.py` | 100% | 100% | No change |
| `baseline_v1.py` | ~98.80% | ~98.80% | Fixed flaky coverage |

### New Tests Added

| Test File | Tests | Coverage |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| `test_m31_training_run.py` | 19 | Schema, generator, integration |
| `test_m08_model.py` | +1 | `test_baseline_policy_v1_forward_uniform_distribution_guaranteed` |

### Missing Tests (Acceptable)

- `m31_training_runner.py` execution paths (13.13% coverage) — **Acceptable**: These are covered during actual training execution

## Security & Supply Chain (Delta-Only)

### Dependency Changes

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Added `types-PyYAML` to dev deps | Type stubs only, no runtime impact |

### Secrets Exposure Risk

🟢 None — No secrets added or exposed

### SBOM/Provenance

🟢 No changes to SBOM generation or provenance
